## Description

In this project, I aim to show that suicidal tendency among people who are diagnosed with Schizophrenia
is not tied to other personal and environmental factors, from a strict statistical point of view, based
on data which was collected in Turkey. This observation was achieved by recognizing clusters in the dataset,
using methods from the discipline of unsupervised machine learning.
