\section{Methods}
\subsection{Dimensionality Reduction}
I used three methods for the reduction of dimensionality.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item PCA
    \item t-SNE
    \item UMAP
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Clustering}
I used three methods for clustering.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item K-Means
    \item DBSCAN
    \item Gaussian Mixture
\end{enumerate}

For methods that are given the expected number of clusters, I have iterated over a range of possible numbers, calculating the silhouette score on each iteration, and updating a stored value of the maximum score. While the minimum number of clusters is naturally 2, the maximum number is a matter of guessing TODO.

For the DBSCAN algorithm, which is not based on calculating centroids, I have used the same parameter for calculating the epsilon parameter, by a heuristic function which divides the total area of the set of data points by this increasing factor, yielding a decreasing set of distances, which are used as the epsilon input parameter.

\subsection{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Columns to Drop

    Many datasets, including the dataset I was working with, have columns that do not carry any real measurable data, specifically the numeric identifier of the data points, usually it will be the first column. Such columns are not only irrelevant for our analysis, they also add noise, and in order to avoid using them in the process of learning, I added an input parameter to the process, telling it to drop specific columns. 
\end{enumerate}
